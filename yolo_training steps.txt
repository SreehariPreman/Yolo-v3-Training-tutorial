? download adhaar card front side photo of atleast 10 
	use labelImg and create classes 
			name
			gender
			DOB
			aadhaar number
			
	create :
		obj.zip
			1.jpg
			1.txt
			2.jpg
			2.txt
			3.jpg
			3.txt
			4.jpg
			4.txt
			5.jpg
			5.txt
			classes.txt
		 
		obj.data	
			class = no.of class
			train =	data/train.txt
			names = data/obj.names
			backup = "path/to/drive" change the path according to you path
		obj.name 
			class names same as like classes.txt
			
		yolo_custom.cfg
			uncomment training batches and subdivisions
			comment testing batches and subdivisions
			max_batches = no.of class*2000
			steps = 80%,90% of max batches
			yolo layer class = no of class
			conv filters = (no.of class + 5)*3 
		generate_train.py
			can use the same for all (change only the extension of the img if needed)
	upload to drive
	
	
	train the model atleast for 150 iterations
		save the model in backup path "yolo_backup/adhaar/backup"
		
troubleshoot:
	
	train.txt
		check if the file is empty or not
		if its empty check the generate_train.py file and change the file extenstion to jpeg/png (based on your image extenstion )
	wrong anotation :
		check   if the number of classes is same for all images in dataset,if not make it same using labelImg
		
	yolo_custom.cfg
		verify if the changes are updated correctly
